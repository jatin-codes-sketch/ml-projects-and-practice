## 🧠 About This Repository

This repository is built to reflect:

- ✅ A **strong understanding of machine learning fundamentals**
- ✅ Practical exposure to **algorithm development**, **model evaluation**, and **data-driven problem solving**
- ✅ Ability to build, structure, and explain **end-to-end ML projects**
- ✅ Code readability, scalability, and best practices followed by top AI engineers

Each project here is selected to show not just how models are trained — but also how they're evaluated, improved, and made production-ready.
